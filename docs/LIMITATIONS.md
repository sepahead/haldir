# Haldir Gate — limitations and what is NOT claimed

This document is normative for honesty. The specification's honesty vocabulary
(*implemented / compiled / tested / validated / published / received / accepted /
applied / observed*) is used exactly. Read it before citing any result.

## What this deliverable is

The **P0 `assurance-reference-v1` profile**: the complete, offline-testable, pure
Rust reference-monitor core. It is **implemented**, **compiled** (rustc 1.96,
edition 2024, `forbid(unsafe_code)`), and **tested** (the full workspace test
suite runs under `cargo test` with `cargo clippy -D warnings` clean).

The defensible claim, stated narrowly:

> Within the in-process P0 profile, the composed Gate enforces the
> contract / state / policy conjunction over the declared command route: an
> unauthorized, malformed, stale, replayed, mission-forbidden, or policy-invalid
> intent does not become a Gate-authored plant command, and each stage the Gate
> actually observes produces distinguishable evidence.

## What is explicitly NOT claimed (out of P0 scope)

None of the following is implemented or tested here. No result about them should
be represented as *validated*, *secure*, *complete-mediation*, or *hardware*.

- **Live secure transport / ACL delivery matrix.** There is no running Zenoh
  router, no mTLS, and no principal×route delivery/non-delivery campaign.
  Invariants **A1** (final-key exclusivity) and **A2** (controller confinement)
  are transport-level properties that in-process tests cannot establish.
  `haldir-transport-zenoh` is a documented seam, not an implementation.
- **`PRE_AUTHORITY_ACL_ONLY` as a proven live property.** It is used here as a
  declared compatibility *label* on the modeled adapter; the live ACL-exclusive
  publication property it names is **UNPROVEN** (needs the transport campaign).
- **Real `ncp-core` / Zenoh dependency.** `haldir-ncp08` is a P0 semantic model of
  the NCP v0.8.0 command frame. It is pinned by digest to the real release but
  does not link the upstream crate. Conformance against the upstream frozen
  corpus is not run here.
- **NEST / Engram controllers.** No neural runtime is present. Admission checks
  digest equality only; **no backend behavioural conformance** (running NEST /
  Norse / Rockpool / XyloSim) is performed. Admission levels A1–A6 are structural
  labels here, not earned behavioural evidence.
- **Crebain / PX4-SITL / Gazebo.** No plant-side integration, no MAVROS, no
  simulator. The `haldir-reference-plant` is a deterministic integer point-mass
  **simulation model**. Its `applied` / `observed response` events are **model
  values, never physical actuation**. `reference-kinematic-hold-v1` safe action is
  simulation-only and must not be reused as evidence for any real vehicle.
- **Second backend / NIR / neuromorphic hardware.** Not attempted. No
  backend-aware admission research result exists.
- **Cross-repository changes** to NCP, Crebain, or Engram. None were made.
- **Performance.** There is no performance/latency campaign. Any timing number is
  "measured on named host/kernel/load; not hard real-time"; **p99/p99.9 on named
  hardware is UNPROVEN**.
- **TLA+ model scope.** The bounded model now checks green under the SHA-verified
  TLA+ v1.7.4 jar (`CL-FORMAL-01`, GitHub run `29211573130`). This proves only the
  registered finite model; the Rust `model` tests remain an independent executable
  encoding, and neither result proves the absent live transport or durable runtime.
- **`missing_docs` hardening.** Deferred; the workspace does not yet
  `deny(missing_docs)`. Crate- and item-level docs are written voluntarily.
- **Durable anti-rollback / restart rollback protection.** The anti-rollback store
  is **in-memory in P0**. It rejects a term/epoch that does not strictly advance its
  high-water and detects structural corruption of its serialized form, but the Gate
  does not persist, load, MAC, or fsync it, and does not derive/compare
  `gate_boot_id` against the monotonic boot counter. Therefore the **cross-restart**
  rollback protection of B11/B12 (a lease minted by a prior incarnation being
  replayed after a restart with a repeated boot id) is **NOT established**. Wiring
  durable persistence (atomic temp→fsync→rename, separate-key MAC for semantic
  rewind detection, boot-id-repeat latch) is future work.
- **Production status.** Not production ready, certified, airworthy, or safe for
  deployment. No independent security review has been performed.

## Independent review record

The delivered P0 core was reviewed by an independent five-lens adversarial pass.
It confirmed the canonical-CBOR/COSE, policy fixed-point, and adapter-conversion
cores sound, and surfaced findings that were then fixed and regression-tested:

- **BUG-2 (fixed):** a monotonic-clock regression while ACTIVE now latches a fault
  and denies (`VehicleActor::mono_ok`) instead of extending a live lease deadline.
- **BUG-3 (fixed):** the reference plant no longer mutates output-authority/replay
  state before its reject checks, so a rejected command cannot wedge the live stream.
- **BUG-4 (fixed):** the intent's self-declared `controller_id`/signing-key id are
  now equality-checked against the admitted controller and the verified signer.
- **BUG-5 (fixed):** freshness age now rounds up (fail-closed), closing a sub-ms
  fail-open at the staleness cap.
- **B1 (clarified + wired):** the authorization-revision counter is now bumped by
  fault-latch and by the `revoke_active_lease` invalidation entry point; the
  mid-pipeline TOCTOU re-check remains structurally present but is inert under the
  current single-threaded in-process actor (it is scaffolding for a future
  concurrent actor). It is not claimed to defeat a real mid-pipeline race here.
- **BUG-1 (carved out):** the durable anti-rollback / restart-rollback gap above.

## Mapping to the completion checklist

See [`COMPLETION-CHECKLIST.md`](COMPLETION-CHECKLIST.md) for the per-item yes/no
with evidence pointers; every "no" maps to an entry above. The specification's own
down-label escape hatch is invoked explicitly: this is a narrower experimental
result than its full Definition-of-Done, and the profile/documentation state
exactly what remains unproven.
